Thinking in terms of binary
===========================
Suppose, n = 4
So total number of subsets are 2^n = 2^4 = 16

Lets answer following questions:
What does it mean there are 16 subsets of set of 4 elements (say A = {3,5,8,9})?
	It means that there are 16 possible combinations of given set. We will see this in detail in later section.

What is the content of each subset?
	Now in terms of binary, it means for 16, subset range is 0..15.
	And each subset 0, subset 1,.. subset 15, is a combination of some elements from original set.

How to find the content or elements in each subset?
	For subset 5, it is represented as 0...0101 (32-bit representation) in binary,
		the bit set to 1 indicates the index of the number to be present in 5th subset.
		So in this case, index 0 & 2 are set to 1.
		So, content of 5th subset is A[0] = 3, A[2] = 5

How to calculate the index from the set bit for given subset?
	There are two methods:
	1. Take 1 and move it j bits left. Then AND it with another 1. If the output is > 0 then its jth index.
		if (1 & (1 << j)) > 0 then jth index is part of subset
		// Iterate through each of 2^n subsets
		for (int i=0; i < (1 << arr.length); i++) {
		  // iterate 0..n indexes only because array size is n elements and we cant get indexOutOfBound element for susbet
		  for (int j=0; j < n; j++) {
		  // for e.g, for subset 5, required index are 0 & 2. 
		  // However, for input array of length 2, index range is 0..1. So, we cant get index2
		  // and also there is no 5th subset as 2^2 = 4 which means only 4 subsets		  
			if ((1 & (1 << j)) > 0) {
				// add element at jth index to subset
				subset.add(A[j])
			}
		  }
		}
	2. Another method, isolate lowest bit using formula x & ~(x-1). The output is an integer (NOT index).
	   To find index, take log base2 of integer i.e. log(base 10)Integer/log(base 10)2

Thinking in terms of combinations		
=================================
how is this related to combinations? What is relation between subset and combination?
	There are 2^4 = 16 subsets of set of 4 elements i.e. all possible combinations of set of 4 elements.
	It means that there are 16 possible combinations of given set i.e.,
	choose 0 from 4 elements = 1  (how? n!/(n-k)!*k! = 4!/4!*0! = 1)
	choose 1 from 4 elements = 4  (how? 4!/3!*1! = 4) 	
	choose 2 from 4 elements = 6  (how? 4!/2!*2! = 6)
  	choose 3 from 4 elements = 4  (how? 4!/1!*3! = 4)
	choose 4 from 4 elements = 1  (how? 4!/0!*4! = 1)
	Add all => 1+4+6+4+1 = 16


What does that mean?
    lets try to understand combination & permutation:

    Combination:
	The formula to calcuate combinations is n!/(n-k)!*k!
	Assume that there are 2 distinct elements A,B
		 To choose 1 from 2 elements,
			either choose A from AB OR choose B from AB
			Total combinations = (A) + (B) = 2
	Assume that there are 3 distinct elements A,B,C
		 To choose 2 from 3 elements,
			either choose AB from ABC OR choose BC from ABC OR choose AC from ABC 
			Total combinations = 3 (how? 3!/1!*2! = 3)
			Note that, AB = BA, BC = CB, AC = CA. Ordering is not important. So, permuatation formula * (1/k!)

    Permutation:
	The formula to calcuate permutations is n!/(n-k)! because AB != BA in permutation. Ordering matters!
	Assume that there are 3 distinct elements A,B,C. So there are 6 permutations of 3 elements (each ordering is considered!)
		Permutation => ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA (3!/0! = 6)
		Combination => ABC (3!/0!*3! = 1) because ABC = ACB = BAC = BCA = CAB = CBA
			That means, output of combination could be any value in (ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA)
		Subset => [], [A], [B], [C], [AB], [CB], [AC], [ABC]
			Note, the 6th element could be CB or BC.. i.e ordering doesnt matter
			Note, subset means all possible length combination
			Note, subset (no ordering) is not same as subsequence (ordering is important)
			Any subarray is subsequence, any subsequence is subset but the reverse is not true.
			(https://www.techiedelight.com/difference-between-subarray-subsequence-subset/)	
		 Arrange 1 from 2 elements i.e. select any 1 from 2 elements to fill first place _ _
			either choose A from AB OR choose B from AB
			Total combinations = (A) + (B) = 2


	Assume that there are 3 distinct & 1 duplicate elements A,A,B,C. 
	So there are 12 permutations of 4 elements considering duplicates (4!/2! = 12)
	Assume that there are 3 distinct & 1 duplicate elements A,A,B,B,B,C. 
	So there are 60 permutations of 4 elements considering duplicates (6!/2!*3! = 60)

What about combination of duplicates?
what about permutation and combination of 2 out of 4 elements OR 3 out of 4 elements?
