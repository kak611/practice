Permutation:
using Tushar roy's unique and lexicograpic algorithm
using recursive algorithm from book
using next permutation logic
Generate next permutation
Generate random permutation using two ways as given in book

Combination:
generate powerset (all possible combinations of all length)
generate random subset (2 solutions as per book)
generate powerset using binary (2 methods)
generate combinations of size k from given set n  (DP problem 'American football' is similar in logic to this one from the book)
