Note:
The only thing need to take precaution in linkedlist is to handle corner cases i.e. the start and the end node pointing to null

For that reason, we use dummyhead with a val=0 and next point to first node or head.
dummyhead is also used to keep track of head of a list

reverse ll iteratively
reverse ll recursively
reverse sublist using o(n) space 
reverse sublist using o(1) space (tricky)
revere k nodes at a time

sll -- DONE
stack using sll
implement double-ended ll
implementation of dll in Java
queue using double-ended ll
doubly-linked list
iterator using dll
