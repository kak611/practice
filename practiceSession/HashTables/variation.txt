{{-1, 1, 0}, {1,0,-1}, {0,2,-2}}
Implement logic to convert above list of list into unique list of list such that ordering doesnt matter, so -1,1,0 == 1,0,-1
Output: {{-1, 1, 0}, {0, 2,-2}}
Hint: look for design of hashtable class in book
	OR
Two list of list of integers are equal (List<List<Integer>>)
	Condition1: elements of list can be in any order [1,-1,0] is same as [1,0,-1]
	condition2: repeated elements are considered as one element in a list [1,0,-1,1] is same as [1,0,-1]

Find all subarrays of given array (time complexity: O(n2))

Implement HashMap/HashSet (uses Hashmap internally)

Implement LinkedHashMap/LinkedHashSet
