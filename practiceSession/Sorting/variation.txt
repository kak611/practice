Merge sort array recursive
Merge sort array iteratively (there is no way to merge two sorted arrays in place in linear time)
Merge sort linkedlist in place (two sorted linked lists can be merged in-place because conceptually, the insertion in middle of linkedlist is o(1) time) (14.9)
insertion sort of array
Insertion sort of linked list (14.9)
Heapsort
does arraylist uses linkedlist internally in sequential indexing way?

Why is stable sort algorithm important?
Why is insertion sort faster for small arrays of size <= 10
Why is heap-sort an in-place algorithm given that it uses some space to maintain heap?
why is quicksort worst case o(n2) and not that of merge and heap sort
What is counting sort?
What is radix sort?
Why is Arrays.sort space complexity n/2 references to objects? what is the sorting algorithm it uses?
Note that Collections.sort converts input to array and uses Arrays.sort internally and put it back in list.
