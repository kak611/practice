comparable vs comparator vs equals (get very comfortable using these techniques)
	Use comparable for natural ordering like Strings, Integers, Doubles, etc
	Comparable is implemented by custom classes based on natural ordering which can do two things:
		1. Check if two objects are ==. If not, then compare using natural ordering
		2. compare first attribute. If its same, then compare on next attribute
	Use comparator for ordering other than natural ordering. For e.g. compare strings based on length, 
	OR Integer comparison should return result in reverse order (a > b ? -1 : ((a < b) ? 1 : 0))
	Prefer creating anonymous class rather than new class with its static object
