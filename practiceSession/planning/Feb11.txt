Solved:
root-to-leaf path with given sum
root-to-leaf sum of binary number

Attempted:
1. num of palindrome substrings. Solved O(n^3)

Completed understanding of:

2 Greedy Algorithms (one is coin change)
median of incoming seq
find longest/num of palindrome substring (2 solutions O(n^2) and O(n))
BST insert/delete

Incomplete:
*System design theory reading
2 solve DP problems (staircase & 2D array)
