== solving ==
Merge two arrays with extra space in first array
Intersection of two sorted arrays
Find subarray covering all strings (Solve Again)

Buy and sell (once, twice, any number of times, k times)
64 bit parity problem (all 4 solutions)
Find all subarrays
Find max sum over subarrays (bruteforce + bruteforce with hashtable, divide and conquer chapter + leetcode solution, dp)
Find subarray with given sum (two solutions on geekforgeeks. How is this different from solution for above problem)
Hashset comparator for subarray {1,0,-1}...

== reading ==
is subarray, subset, combination the same?
	Check Tushar Roy's solution for all combinations of string and compare with subset problem from recursion chapter
Generate permutation of string (DONE) check difference in solution with the one given in recursion chapter.
	Also, compare this with the one given in CTCI
Red-black tree	(reading done.. need to know insertion and deletion)
Trie data structure



== backlog of problems to solve from chapters ==
