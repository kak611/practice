Implement Binary tree in level order (complete binary tree) and print 2D
Implement following traversals of Binary Tree:
	preorder (DFS traversal simulate stack using recursion)
	inorder (DFS traversal simulate stack using recursion)
	postorder (DFS traversal simulate stack using recursion)
Implement inorder travesal iteratively in O(1) space
Print Binary tree in level-order traversal (see Tushar Roy's video)

Todo:
Insert node in Binary tree in level order 
	(While level order traversal (i.e. using queue), if a node's left child is empty add new node, if node's right child is empty add new node; else continue to next node)

Delete node in Binary Tree:
	While level order traversal (i.e. using queue), Find the deepest and rightmost element E in the tree. Swap E with the element to be deleted. Delete E.
